But as its society changes for its diverse demographics and the new generation emerging, the acceptance to new ideas are now opening doors to new concepts; both seen in a negative and positive perspectives. The acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, to this very day is an ongoing debate not just in Japan but in other countries as well. Although despite the adversaries, we see events such as marathons, gatherings, the media covering them or even individuals advocating for their cause.&nbsp;</div>

On her pursuit on gender studies master’s degree at ICU, her thesis focuses on LGBTQ+ community’s situation in Japan, specifically on companies and their policies geared towards them.<br><br>I started asking her the very foundation of how she came up with such topic.<br><br>Evan: “How did you come up with such topic? What was the story behind it?”
<br>
<br>Mami: “During my freshman year as an undergraduate student, I studied about gender-studies specifically women’s rights. My initial impression towards it was that it was solely reserved for feminism when in fact it is a very broad subject, at the time I did not even know what LGBTQ+ means. My interest was furthered when I had my exchange program in Los Angeles, California at University of California Los Angeles for a year studying gender-studies.”
<br>
<br>Evan: “Oh wow, for a year, how was the experience?”
<br>
<br>Mami: “One year felt like a blink of an eye for me, but it was an immersive experience! The first day of class, the professor asked as one by one regarding our preferred pronoun; whether we wanted to be called he, she, they, them or even it! It was a very new concept for me.”&nbsp;<br><br>Evan: "But a lot can happen in a year, what were your observations?"</p>

Feeling giddy and excited she jumped to the differences of what's it like in Los Angeles compared Tokyo.<br><br>Mami: "The pronouns was nothing, in LA, same-sex couples are free from judgement; holding hands, kissing and all forms of love and affection are everywhere."<br><br><br></p>

So far Japanese people who are part of the community and even allies are paving ways to get their voices heard, the key is to keep the conversation going, that this is not just another fad that would pass in time, but an ongoing talk until we reach our end goal, which is equality."<br><br>Evan: "In Japan, how do you think are the people responding towards this? or to you advocating for this movement"<br><br>Mami: "Mixed emotions I'd say. I have friends and family who applaud me for what I stand for, of course not everyone are on board, some question me for it isn't the norm and I'm not even an LGBTQ+ member, the more I hear this however, the more I would champion my cause for there's a need to it; you don't have to be gay to defend them, what they ask for is acceptance and as human in general it is the humane thing to do."<br><br>Evan: "We do know such change would not happen overnight, but do you see it happening in the near future or in our lifetime even?"<br><br>Mami: "People are becoming aware now, that we have these kind of situations and what's needed is understanding and compassion. I'm advocating this because I have friends who are a member and needed their voice to be heard. I have the means to help so why shouldn't I? Indeed change is hard and in the context of Japan traditions and norms are harder to change, but I think we have a chance for we see the effort around us, 2 days ago an LGBTQ+ event called Rainbow Marathon was held prior to the Tokyo marathon yesterday. 479 runners joined and the age varied from teenagers to senior citizens, I think that speaks for itself. If this discrimination is the rain, then the outcome of acceptance will be the rainbow amidst it".&nbsp;</p>
